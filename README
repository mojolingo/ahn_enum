This gem is a component for Adhearsion (http://adhearsion.com)

ENUM is a distributed system for converting PSTN phone numbers into VoIP URIs.
This component was inpired by a blog post by Team Forrest:
http://www.teamforrest.com/blog/177/use-enum-to-save-real-money/

USAGE:
Add this component to your Adhearsion application's config/startup.rb
Example:

    config.component "ahn_enum"

Next install the sample configuration:
    $ rake components:genconfig

Customize config/components/ahn_enum.yml as necessary.  For example,
to use the ENUMPlus.org backend you must supply your API key.

To look up ENUM numbers in Adhearsion use this command within dialplan.rb:

    example_context {
      destination = '14044754840'
      newdest = enum_lookup(destination)
    
      if newdest.nil?
        # No match found.  Dial the regular PSTN number.
      else
        # A VoIP route was found!  Use newdest
      end
    }

Enjoy!
